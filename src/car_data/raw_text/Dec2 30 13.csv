""The new E-Class is a lot more powerful and more capable than the E-Class, and it also has a very strong brand that is very well known,"" said Mr. Bernhard. ""So we're trying to bring that to the new generation car, and we're also helping with the marketing. And I think we're going to make a lot of progress to make that happen.""

The Focus is also lighter than the Camry, with a curb weight of just 3,250 pounds, and it weighs just 3,800 pounds.

The Focus' front end is also a little bit more aggressive. The Focus has a four-wheel-drive system, but that's not what you'll find in the Camry. The Camry's 4.0-liter V-8 is paired with a four-wheel-drive system, and it's paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Focus also has a standard front seat, which is slightly more comfortable than the Camry's standard seat. The Focus does not come standard with a rear armrest, which is a bit odd.

In fact, Chevrolet has been making cars since it was founded in 1929.
