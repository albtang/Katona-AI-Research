The lawsuit, filed by a female student in September, claims that Prof. John Davidson, a professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, sexually harassed her in a way that ""was not in the best interest of the university.""

The suit says Davidson allegedly used his position of authority as an associate dean of students to coerce the female student into having sex with him.

The lawsuit alleges that Davidson and a female student had a sexual relationship in the fall of 2014. The lawsuit says that Davidson asked the female student to participate in a ""sexually explicit video"" with him and then when she refused, he allegedly ""threatened violence against her and her family if she did not comply.""

The lawsuit says that Davidson has denied making any threats and the female student did not report the incident to university officials.

The lawsuit claims that Davidson has been suspended from his position as an associate dean of students.

The lawsuit states that Davidson's lawyer, Andrew McEwan, has been suspended from his position as a professor at the Rotman School of Management.

The latest allegations are made by a woman named Jessica Leeds, who claims that Trump groped her when she was a 16-year-old intern at the Trump Organization in the early 1990s.

According to Leeds, Trump groped her while she was sitting in his office in the 1990s, and then proceeded to pull down her dress, which caused her to ""thrust her head back and moan"".

""I felt like I was being raped,"" she told The New York Times.

The woman said she was initially reluctant to come forward with the allegations because she was afraid of losing her job, but decided to do so after seeing the video of the alleged incident.

In addition, electric cars can be more affordable. According to the Wall Street Journal, the average price of a Model S is about $62,000, which is the same price as the average electric car.

Folta says that the Model S is the best-selling electric car in the US, and he believes that it's due in large part to the fact that it's a luxury car.

The US Energy Department said it had not received confirmation from the Japanese government that the plan to sell off its stake in the plant had been approved by the Japanese parliament.

The US government had been planning to sell off the plant's assets in Japan for the first time since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that triggered the meltdowns.

The government had hoped to sell the plant's assets in the US, but the plan was delayed until next year.

The US government had been considering selling off the plant's assets in Japan for a decade, but the plan was delayed until this year.

The US government had said it would sell off the plant's assets in Japan for $7.8 billion (£4.9 billion) and that the US government would bear the cost of the sale.

The US government had initially planned to sell off the plant's assets in Japan for $9.5 billion (£6.2 billion), but the plan was delayed until next year.

A Japanese government spokesman said on Tuesday that the government was still considering the sale.

The company said it was investigating the allegations, which it said were ""without foundation"".

""We have never used software that violates the law, and we will act appropriately and promptly to ensure that we are able to meet our obligations,"" it said in a statement.

The scandal involving VW's diesel engines is believed to have been the biggest scandal in its history. It is not known whether it was the result of the software.

VW was forced to recall almost 4.1m cars worldwide last year, and about 2.5m of them involved diesel engines.

The scandal has been linked to the use of software that allowed software to be installed on diesel engines that failed emissions tests.

The software was installed on some cars in the US and Europe, and on some in the UK.

The scandal has led to VW being sued by US authorities, and the company has been ordered to pay $18bn (£11bn) in fines.

Volkswagen admitted that it had installed software that could change the way the engines worked, and that it had been aware of the problem for some time.

The company said it was ""confident"" that it would eventually be able to rectify the problem.

The company also said it would offer an upgrade to its diesel cars"

The court ruled 5-4 that the state's ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional. It also said that the state's ban on gay marriage was not intended to discriminate against gay couples.

The ruling was a victory for the conservative justices, who have been known to be more liberal than the court's conservative members.

""This decision affirms Texas' commitment to the fundamental principle that marriage is a union between one man and one woman,"" Justice Samuel Alito said in a statement. ""It also affirms that the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage was not intended to discriminate against same-sex couples.""

The court's decision came less than a week after the justices ruled 5-4 in favor of same-sex marriage in California. The court's decision is likely to be appealed, but while the state of California has not yet ruled on whether it will follow suit, the Supreme Court has held in the past that it will not take up the issue of gay marriage.

Tesla's battery technology is based on a process known as electrolysis. The company says it can make batteries with up to 90 percent efficiency, which means it can produce 1000 kWh of energy in a single charge.

It's also the only company to produce batteries with multiple batteries in a single unit.

The company also sells the battery packs that are used by Teslas.

Here's how it works:

The battery packs are packed with a combination of lithium ion and nickel oxide. The nickel oxide is the electrolyte that is used to make the battery cells.

The nickel oxide is also the electrolyte in the entire pack that is used to make the battery cells.

The nickel oxide is dissolved in water and then evaporated to generate electricity. The water and nickel oxide is then combined with lithium ion to form the lithium ion electrolyte.

The lithium ion is then combined with a solution of lithium carbonate to form lithium carbonate batteries.

The total amount of lithium carbonate in the battery pack is around 100 mg/kg, which is about 1.5 mg/kg of lithium carbonate per 100 mg of water.

The lithium carbonate is then used to make the lithium ion batteries.

The court ruled 5-4 that a state law that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment and housing violates the U.S. Constitution.

The Court's decision has implications for several states, including Florida, which passed a law in 2013 that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment and housing. The law, which was challenged in federal court, was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been drafting rules that would make it easier for Internet service providers to block websites that carry content deemed offensive to Muslims, Christians, Jews, or other religious minorities.

The proposed rules would also expand the FCC's authority to regulate Internet service providers, and could allow the agency to require Internet service providers to block websites that threaten or promote violence.

The rules are the latest effort by the government to address the growing threat of online terror. Last month, the FCC proposed sweeping new rules to crack down on online content that promotes terrorism or encourages violence.

I agree with Yglesias that Obamacare isn't working. He points out that the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the law will cost the government $600 billion in 2019 and $1.2 trillion in 2026.
