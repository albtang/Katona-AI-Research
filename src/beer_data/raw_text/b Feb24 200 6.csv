The blocks had a lot of different shapes, and they had a lot of different textures. You had to build the blocks to fit the colors, and you had to move them to fit the shapes.

The Pew Research Center's annual survey of American attitudes on religion found that the share of Americans who say religion is important in their lives has increased from 35 percent in 2001 to 43 percent in 2011. The share saying religion is not important in their lives has dropped from 19 percent in 2001 to 15 percent in 2011.

The pollsters also found that the share of Americans who say religion is not important in their lives has increased from 38 percent in 2001 to 51 percent in 2011.

So there's a lot of change in the American majority, and the Pew pollsters seem to be finding it.

But the question that strikes me is this:

What's the reason for all this change?

I think the answer is that the American majority has gotten a lot better at telling pollsters it's not important in their lives.

I want to go through the pollsters' answers and see what they mean by ""not important in their lives.""

The president, who has rejected the notion that Russia was behind the hacks, has called on the two countries to get to the bottom of the matter.

The FBI had been investigating the server since 2013, after it was discovered that she used a private server to conduct official government business. The FBI later determined that the server was compromised by a hacker—a hacker who was known to the FBI. (The FBI said it had not yet determined who was responsible.)

The revelation, which came in a letter to Congress, is a huge blow for Clinton. The FBI had been investigating her email practices for several months, and the fact that they had found evidence of her wrongdoing meant that she would be forced to concede defeat in the presidential race.

But that's not the only bombshell in the Clinton news this morning.
