The employee, who was not named in the report, has been charged with unauthorized removal of classified documents.

The charges stemmed from a leak of classified information to The Guardian, which was one of the most widely read newspapers in the country.

The government says the employee was motivated to leak information because it was ""important to him"".

""We're aiming to be the first craft beer that's going to have a big impact on the world,"" said Brian Wood, the head brewer at Chiltern Brewing. ""We're trying to make it a thing that people will remember.""

Chiltern Brewing is the latest in a line of craft breweries to open in Northern Virginia.

To be eligible for the program, breweries must have at least 100,000 barrels of beer brewed and sold in the United States. That number can fluctuate depending on the size of the brewery, but the program is intended to give drinkers a chance to try new beers before they're in the market.

The program is expected to generate $1 million in revenue in the first year, and the company's marketing team hopes to win over local beer drinkers with promotional videos and educational materials.

""We're trying to make it a thing that people will remember,"" Wood said. ""We've done the research, we've done the research, we've been able to generate some great videos and content.""

The program is currently in its infancy, but Wood said he expects it will eventually be ""a national phenomenon.""

The program was announced Wednesday night at the annual Craft Brewers Conference in Washington, D.C.

The program's first event at Chiltern Brewing was held at the Chiltern Brewery in May.

That's the conclusion of a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that says the value of the US dollar is down nearly 35% against the euro since the beginning of 2014.

The reason for the weak value of the dollar, according to the analysis, is that the US does not have enough demand for its goods and services, even though the US economy is growing at a strong clip.

This is why the US has been able to record record its fastest annual growth since the Great Depression, and why the US is now the world's largest economy.
