Thank you for joining us today. Thank you for having me here. I'm very pleased to be here today.

There's a lot to talk about in this session. The issue of alcohol and the appropriate role of government is one of the most important issues of our time.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recently published a report that found that one in four children ages 6 to 17 has used alcohol. That's a startling figure, but it's a very serious one.

The most important thing we can do is to address it, and that's why we have to have a very serious conversation about how we're going to address this issue.

We have to talk about what's been going on with the rate of alcohol use. We have to talk about the impact that alcohol has on families. We have to talk about the impact that alcohol has on kids. We have to talk about the impact that alcohol has on adolescents.

We can't ignore the fact that we have a serious problem with alcohol, and we have to address it.

AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline, the $3.8 billion project to transport oil from North Dakota's Bakken region to Illinois. The project, which has drawn widespread opposition from Native American tribes, has been blocked by the Army Corps of Engineers. Last week, the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would not grant the permit necessary for construction of the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe, a sacred burial site for Native Americans.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says the pipeline threatens its water supply and sacred sites. The Army Corps of Engineers has said it will not approve the pipeline unless the tribe can demonstrate the pipeline will not harm drinking water. On Wednesday, the Army Corps of Engineers denied the tribe's request for a temporary restraining order preventing the pipeline from crossing the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

""The whole idea of the craft beer industry is that you can make your own beer,"" says Blumberg. ""If you're a small brewery, you can't make your own beer. You have to buy it from a distributor.""
