Well, you're not alone.

In fact, it's become a common occurrence that the party is over, and everyone has left.

But what if you could go back in time and see what would have happened if you had stayed?

That's what a group of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have done, and they've created a holographic simulation of the event, called ""The Ghost of the Party.""

The team used a computer simulation to simulate the event, which is what they call a ""ghost simulation."" The simulation was created to help scientists understand the behavior of the human brain, and how it can make sense of the events that happen in the real world.

The researchers tested the simulation on 10 people, and found that they could see the same things they saw in their own minds.

The researchers say that they're excited by their findings, because they suggest that the human brain can process information in a way similar to a hologram.
