A few years ago, a not-so-popular website called ""The Rules"" published a list of rules for the game of Monopoly. This list was a bit too long to fit in one article, so I decided to take a stab at an article about the rules.

This article is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to every rule in Monopoly, nor is it meant to be an exhaustive list of all the rules. Rather, I hope that it will be useful to those who are new to the game, but who would rather skip the rules and just play the game to get started.

The Rules

1. The game starts with a single player, and he must build a house.

2. The player who builds the first house wins.

3. The player who builds the second house wins.

4. The player who builds the third house wins.

5. The player who builds the fourth house wins.

6. The player who builds the fifth house wins.

The company's beers include the popular Goose Island Double IPA, the Wild Turkey Double IPA, the Goose Island Pale Ale and the Goose Island Amber Ale.

The company is also selling a line of flavored cans of Goose Island beer.

In fact, he's issued more than 100 executive orders since taking office, and his administration has been working on a new one for months.

The new executive order, which Obama signed on April 28, is called ""Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States."" It's a ""major step to strengthen our nation's immigration enforcement system,"" according to the White House.

Here's what the order says:

""The President hereby directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate a senior official of the Department of Homeland Security to serve as the Chief of Enforcement for the Department of Homeland Security, to report to the President regularly on the progress of the Department's efforts to enforce our immigration laws, and to provide guidance and assistance to the Executive Branch on the implementation of those laws.""

The order also calls for the creation of a ""National Security Council"" to ""develop a comprehensive strategy for the enforcement of our immigration laws,"" and to ""exercise oversight authority over the Department of Homeland Security.""

Here's the full text of the order:

We are living in a culture that is not only profoundly hostile to the idea of the separation of church and state, but also deeply hostile to the idea of the separation of church and state. This hostility is not limited to the religious. It extends to the political as well.

A well-known example of this hostility is the recent Supreme Court decision in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges. The case concerned a state statute that required gay couples in Kentucky to obtain state-issued marriage licenses. The Court held that the state's law violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it imposed a tax on the exercise of religious beliefs.

The case was decided by the Court's liberal majority, which included Justices Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and"

It's also a far cry from the popular California-style beer, which is typically served with a variety of toppings. The brewery's beer is also less tart than its predecessor, which makes it more palatable to those who like their beer lighter.

The brewery will be opening its first brewery in the city of Olathe in early 2016.

""Olathe is a great market for us because it's a great place to grow and grow our business,"" said Porter. ""We're looking forward to opening our first brewery in Olathe and bringing a new experience to the city.""

Porter said the brewery will be working with local officials to help make the town's beer scene more attractive.

""We want to bring a lot of people to the area and we want people to come to us for a beer,"" he said. ""We want to create a great environment for people to come and enjoy beer.""

The brewery will be located at 621 W. Union St., and the taproom will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.

Porter said the brewery will also be using a portion of the proceeds from the brewery to help local charities.

That's the conclusion of a study released Thursday by the National Education Association (NEA) that found that students who take standardized tests are eight times more likely to fail in school than those who don't.

""The findings of this study are very troubling,"" NEA President Regan Eskew said in a press release. ""Our children are paying the price for failing to improve their test scores, and it's time that we take action to get them back on track.""

The study, which examined the test scores of more than 11,500 students in grades 7, 8 and 9, found that students who scored in the top 10 percent on standardized tests are almost twice as likely to fail as those in the bottom half.

The NEA also found that students who scored in the bottom 10 percent on standardized tests are almost four times as likely to fail as those in the top half.

The WHO said the latest study, published in the journal Lancet, was the first to report evidence of the virus causing such a condition in any country, but it did not provide a timeline for when the country would be able to confirm the results.

""It is very important that we continue to monitor and investigate the situation in the affected countries, and to ensure that we provide the best possible support to all affected individuals,"" WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in a statement.

Zika has been linked to birth defects such as microcephaly and microcephaly-like birth defects, which affect the brain and spinal cord. The virus is spread through mosquito bites and can be transmitted from mother to fetus.

The WHO said Monday that it had collected and analyzed samples from more than 2,700 pregnant women in Brazil and the Dominican Republic, and found that Zika was present in only 1.5 percent of the samples.

The WHO said it was not able to determine whether the virus was spreading through the blood of pregnant women or whether it was being passed on to their fetuses through sex.

Mr. D'Arcy said the name change is due to the fact that the company has been struggling for years to gain a foothold in the craft beer industry. The company, which is based in the Falls Church area, is owned by a group of investors, including Mr. D'Arcy and his wife, Jodi.

""We are trying to grow our brand, and we have been trying to grow our brand for the last five years,"" said Mr. D'Arcy. ""We're trying to get it to be recognized as one of the better brands, and we feel we've done a good job of that.""

Mr. D'Arcy said the company has been making beer for about 40 years, but the idea of creating a new beer brand was born during a trip to the brewery in 2008.

But now, a new poll shows that the term has become a rallying cry for conservatives.

The poll, conducted by the Marquette Law School Polling Institute, found that the phrase comes up in three out of four conservative responses to the question, ""To what extent do you think it's appropriate for a politician to use the term 'douchebag' to describe a person who acts inappropriately or acts in a way that is inappropriate?""

The poll found that 90 percent of Republicans and 92 percent of independents said it's appropriate to call someone a ""douchebag.""

The decision will also have a major impact on the future of the Obama administration's efforts to roll back these voting rights laws. In the last several years, the Obama administration has rolled back the voting rights of millions of people with no evidence of any discrimination. The administration has also been working to dismantle the Voting Rights Act, and the Supreme Court's decision will likely be a big step in the right direction.
