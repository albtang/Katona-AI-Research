It's been a long time coming, but today the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case of a man who was denied his birth certificate because he is gay. The case is being brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the Center for Reproductive Rights.

When he applied for his birth certificate, he was told he was not eligible because he is gay. Because of that, Smith was denied his right to vote.

Smith is not the only gay man who has been denied his right to vote because of his sexual orientation. In 2004, a man named David M. Peterson was denied a ballot because he was gay. Peterson was born in New Jersey and was denied a vote because of his sexual orientation.

In the spring of 2009, just as Barack Obama was about to take office, the Bush administration began a massive propaganda campaign against the United States and its allies in the region, the Arab world, and the West. The campaign was called Operation Iraqi Freedom and it was intended to convince the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that the United States had to invade Iraq so that we could eliminate him. It was a campaign that was, at its core, a lie.

This was a lie that was designed to promote the idea that the United States had invaded Iraq in order to destroy Saddam Hussein and that the invasion was necessary to prevent a new Iraq from emerging. The idea was, in short, to convince the world that the United States was bent on destroying the country of Iraq and that the invasion was necessary to protect the country.
