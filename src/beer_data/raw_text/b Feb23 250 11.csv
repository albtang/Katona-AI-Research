AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to the story of a woman who was arrested in 2008 for running a business in a strip mall. In that case, the woman was charged with violating a city ordinance that prohibited prostitution in the city's Little Italy strip mall. Prosecutors alleged that she had advertised prostitution in a business that sold clothes and other items, and that she used her position to solicit and pay customers. The city's attorney argued that the ordinance was invalid because it did not distinguish between prostitution and general solicitation. A judge ruled against the city, and the case was dismissed.

The New York Times reported in March 2009 that the city's attorney, Thomas P. O'Neill, had been the lead attorney in the case. Then, in July 2009, the city's attorney, Robert R. Kelly, announced that he would resign, citing poor health. He also announced that the case would be dismissed.

So who is the best pitcher in the American League right now?

The Yankees' best pitcher is right now, and it's not even close.

There's no doubt about it; the best pitcher in the American League right now is the Texas Rangers' Yu Darvish.
