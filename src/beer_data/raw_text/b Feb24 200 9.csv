The Eagles have a lot of receivers that could be available in the first round, including cornerback Ronald Darby and offensive tackle Lane Johnson.

But they also have an opportunity to add a playmaker to their receiving corps.

Funchess is considered one of the top receivers in the country. He's a big, physical receiver that can beat his man and make plays downfield.

Funchess has a ton of upside, and he's a great fit for the Eagles.

They could use a playmaker at receiver, but they also have to consider other options. The Eagles have several receivers that can play tight end, but they also have a need at receiver.

The Eagles have two receivers that could fit that bill: tight end Zach Ertz and running back Darren Sproles.
