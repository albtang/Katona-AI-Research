Researchers from the University of Michigan found that between 2009 and 2012, the number of people who reported using their smartphones to keep in touch with friends and family increased by a whopping 4.5 percent. This trend is the type of trend that's been observed in other countries, but it appears to be increasing in the United States.

The researchers say that the increase is likely due to the fact that the web is becoming more popular, especially among young people, and that it's becoming harder for people to keep their phones in their pockets.

The study says that there are two main reasons for the increase: the increased use of social media and the increase in mobile devices.

The study suggests that the rise in smartphone use is related to the fact that people are starting to use them more frequently.

Poroshenko, who has been in power since 2014 and is the world's oldest head of state, has signed a decree allowing him to appoint his own ministers. He has also said he will make changes to the constitution and appoint his own prime minister.

The bill, which was approved by parliament and is now being debated in the lower house of parliament, would allow Poroshenko to appoint his own ministers and allow him to appoint the speaker of parliament, a key post in Ukraine's political system.

Poroshenko has been widely accused of undermining the country's independence and of being a puppet of Russia, where he has ruled since 2014.

The new law would give him the power to appoint his own ministers, saying they would have to be appointed under the same law that had been in force since 2014.
