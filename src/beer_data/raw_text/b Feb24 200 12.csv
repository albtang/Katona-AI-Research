Harbaugh, who was hired by the 49ers in October, will have a special role at the helm of the team. He'll be in charge of the club's scouting department, which will focus on players who could be considered for the 2016 NFL Draft.

Harbaugh will be responsible for the organization's scouting department, too. He'll oversee the team's draft picks and personnel.

The 49ers also announced that they have hired former NFL team personnel executive Brian Xanders as a consultant. Xanders will work with the team's personnel department, and is expected to work closely with Harbaugh on the recruiting aspect of the organization.

The 49ers are in the midst of a rebuild of their coaching staff. The team is reportedly looking to hire a new head coach as early as this week, and they've already hired former NFL and college head coach Chip Kelly as their new offensive coordinator.

The American public has been waiting for a presidential candidate to actually say something about the country's foreign policy. And they haven't been getting one.

Let's start with the obvious: Hillary Clinton's campaign has been losing in the polls. Trump has been winning them.

The latest from the RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Clinton leading Trump by 2.5 points in a hypothetical general election matchup. That's a significant improvement over her 1.7-point margin in the same poll a week ago.

But the Clinton campaign won't be able to take advantage of this. Her campaign is in the middle of a massive fundraising effort to try to build a case for her candidacy. And with the campaign's fundraising efforts, the Clinton campaign is also trying to cash in on the enthusiasm of voters.

So, as the campaign continues to struggle, the Clinton campaign is going to have to come up with something.

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Clinton's top advisers are saying they"

The plan is to use the prisoners, mostly from Latin America, to take part in an ""Islamic State training camp"" in Jordan.

The plan has been made public in a secret White House document, but it's not clear whether this is what the plan actually is, or if the plan is simply a way to get the US to do something it's never done before.

TORONTO -- The federal government has announced it will spend $5.5 million over two years to help pay for a new, more secure electronic voting system for federal elections.

The $5.5-million commitment will be made in the form of funds provided by Elections Canada to help fund the new system.

The system will be installed in the new electronic voting machines used in the upcoming federal election, which are expected to be launched on Nov. 4.

Elections Canada said the new electronic voting machine will be able to record votes and will be more secure than the current electronic voting machines used in the past.

The new electronic voting system will enable voters to verify the accuracy of their vote and will also allow for more accurate tabulation of the vote.

Elections Canada said it will also help to install new poll workers to ensure that the new system is being used effectively.
