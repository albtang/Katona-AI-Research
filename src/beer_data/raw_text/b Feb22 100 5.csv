Tasting Notes

When we first visited the brewery in early 2015, we were blown away by the beer's complexity. The beer has a distinct hop character, and it really shines when you're drinking it with a glass of wine or a beer. It's a very complex beer, and it fully deserves its reputation as one of the best pale ales around.

We also had a chance to try the beer with our friends, who are all homebrewers. The beer is a little bit different from what we were expecting, but it's still delicious.

The beer was a little more mellow than we were expecting, and it had a light, crisp flavor to it. It's a really good beer, and it's definitely worth the price.

Finally, we should mention that the beer will be available in the United States on draft for the first time in the United States on February 4th.
