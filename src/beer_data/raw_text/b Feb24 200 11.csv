The report, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a survey of more than 1.5 million Americans. The study found that the number of obese people increased from 1.4 million in 2011 to 2.1 million in 2012.

This increase is ""concerning,"" said Dr. Barry Reiss, an obesity researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. ""We're at a critical point in our understanding of why this is occurring,"" he said.

The increase in obesity rates is ""very alarming,"" he said. ""It's a very large proportion of the population. It's a very big problem.""

Obesity is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. Overweight people are considered to have a BMI of 30 or higher.

The study found that the number of people who were obese in 2012 was about three times higher than in 2011. The number of obese people increased from 687,000 in 2011 to 991,000 in 2012.

The ruling comes less than a week after the U.S. government asked a federal judge in San Francisco to dismiss the lawsuit, which was brought by Apple CEO Tim Cook and other Apple employees.

In the lawsuit, the government argued that the FBI's refusal to unlock the phone was illegal under the U.S. Constitution because the government could not compel Apple to help it unlock the phone. It also argued that the government was improperly using the Fifth Amendment, which prevents government officials from ""unreasonable searches and seizures.""

The judge dismissed the lawsuit on Friday.

The lawsuit, filed in December, alleged that the FBI had violated the Fourth Amendment by forcing Apple to create a backdoor into the phone, which it could not unlock.

The case was brought by the FBI and the National Security Agency, which are trying to unlock a phone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. The FBI and NSA are seeking to force Apple to assist them in working on a way to unlock the phone, which could"
