In the 1960s, it was involved in assassinations and the cover-up of its own activities, including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It also helped cover up the CIA's role in the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, which was a direct result of the CIA's involvement in the Bay of Pigs.
