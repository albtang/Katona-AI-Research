The move comes after the government approved a decree to allow diesel vehicles in some new vehicles, including those with automatic transmission.

The decree, which is expected to go into effect on Monday, states that ""it is necessary to ensure the safety, reliability and environmental protection of the Russian population and the environment.""

Moscow has been struggling with the issue of air pollution and fuel consumption after a transportation ban on diesel vehicles and the introduction of a fuel-economy standard in the late 1990s.

The bill passed in the Duma on Wednesday, with the main opposition Democratic Party of Russia (DPR) and the Green Party of Russia supporting it.

The bill also includes a ban on diesel cars with automatic transmissions, which would allow the introduction of hybrids.

The bill was approved by the Duma on Tuesday, but it needs to be approved by the upper house of parliament.

The Russian government has been struggling to implement the law, which comes into force from January 1, and has been criticized by some carmakers, who say the law would make it more difficult for them to sell vehicles with automatic transmissions.

The new law also bans new diesel vehicles from being sold in Russia, which will limit the number of new vehicles to 100,000 a year from the current 100,000.

While the company has been able to make significant gains in recent years, it's still facing a lot of challenges.

First, the company is facing a huge amount of legal challenges, including a class action lawsuit filed by more than 200,000 consumers.

The lawsuit alleges that the diesel vehicles in question were sold in the US with deceptive and misleading advertising, and that Volkswagen is responsible for the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the US.

In addition, a class action lawsuit is currently being brought by people who say they were affected by Volkswagen's diesel cars in the US.

On top of that, the company has been hit with multiple class action lawsuits from customers who claim they were cheated out of their money.

The company is also facing a class action lawsuit filed by a man who says he was cheated out of $14,000 after buying a new car from one of the company's dealerships.

All of these legal challenges have led to a lot of pressure on the company, which says it's working to resolve them.

But the company's CEO, Dieter Zetsche, says the company is working hard to make sure that the situation doesn't escalate any further.

The automaker is using a new technology called sensor fusion, which it says is capable of saving about 10 percent of fuel by using a magnetic field to generate an electric charge.

The technology works by using a magnetic field to push a magnetic field into the fuel cell, which then generates electricity, or, as Mercedes-Benz calls it, ""the electric charge.""

The concept is similar to a high-tech hub that sends electrical energy into the fuel cell, but unlike conventional hub technology, the electric charge is generated by a continuous magnetic field.

""With sensor fusion, we are able to produce a continuous magnetic field that is very strong and can push the fuel cell in a very precise and controlled way,"" said Mercedes-Benz's Chief Technology Officer, Thomas Schulze, in a press release.

The technology could also help Mercedes-Benz save fuel by using a different form of charging.

""The electric charge can be used to power a fully electric vehicle, such as a hybrid car, or a plug-in hybrid, or a gasoline-powered vehicle, such as a Mercedes-Benz S-Class,"" Schulze said.

235," A-Class is the car that Mercedes-Benz has been rumored to be building for the last several years, but it didn't go over well with the public. It was thought that the car would be running on a hybrid system, but that was never confirmed.

The A-Class concept was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show, and although there was some controversy with the car's styling, Mercedes-Benz is hoping to be able to make a car that's more affordable than the current A-Class.

The A-Class is the latest in a line of Mercedes-Benz models which have been rumored to be coming to the U.S. for a while now. The A-Class was shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show last year, and the company has promised that it'll be coming to the U.S. in 2017.

The A-Class is expected to be offered in two models, the A-Class E-Class and the A-Class G-Class. Both of the models will have a base price of around $50,000, but they will be available in a variety of different options.

The A-Class E-Class is expected to come with a 1.6-liter turbocharged engine, and will be available in either a four-cylinder or a seven-cylinder configuration. The base price for the E-Class is expected to be around $50,000.

AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to the latest developments in the investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The incident began when a Ferguson police officer allegedly shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, a black man, in the back. The officer, Darren Wilson, was fired and charged with second-degree murder.

A grand jury decided not to indict Wilson. But after a week-long investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday it was opening an inquiry into the shooting. The Justice Department said it would appoint a federal prosecutor to investigate the shooting.

The investigation will be led by former New York City police officer Robert McCulloch, former deputy district attorney for the Western District of Missouri.

The announcement comes as automakers and tech giants head into a crucial period of their respective business cycles, with the first quarter of 2016 expected to be the most expensive in history.

The announcement comes after a report earlier this year by the European Commission that warned that the global economy was on the brink of a ""new economic crisis"" unless global leaders took action to curb climate change.

The report said that unless action was taken, ""the global economy will continue to face significant challenges in the coming decades.""

It also said that the global economy was in a ""critical period"" because of the ""smashing of the global economy"" and ""the failure of many countries to develop their economies.""

The report was based on a study by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Automakers are pushing for a shift to electric vehicles, which are more fuel-efficient than gas-powered ones, and to a zero-emission vehicle fleet.

But the report warned that the world is not yet ready to embrace electric vehicles because of the challenges they pose to the environment.
