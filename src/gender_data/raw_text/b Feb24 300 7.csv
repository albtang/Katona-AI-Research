They've signed a number of free agents, including wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., defensive end Olivier Vernon and defensive tackle Damon Harrison. They've also made some big draft moves, including the selection of defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson, who is expected to be the first overall pick in this year's NFL draft.

But all of those moves have come with a price tag.

The Giants are set to pay $16.6 million in guaranteed money to the player they selected with the No. 1 overall pick, according to the New York Observer. That's nearly $8 million per year for the first five years of the deal.

The remaining $16.6 million of the deal is fully guaranteed. That's a figure the Giants can increase with the signing of a third player, which they are expected to do.

The Giants are committed to paying the rest of the guaranteed money out of pocket.
