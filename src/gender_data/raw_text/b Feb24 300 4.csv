The FIA has said it is considering a proposal from Mercedes to replace the current F1 engine with a hybrid version of the engine that will be used in the Mercedes-Benz F1 team.

The proposed change would see the engine replaced with a hybrid version of the Honda-powered engine, which will also be used in the Mercedes-Benz F1 team.

The proposal was made by the FIA on Monday to the Mercedes Automotive Engineering and Technical Centre in Toulouse, France, for the development of a hybrid engine.

The engine will be used in the Mercedes-Benz F1 team for the first time in the 2017 season.

The hybrid engine would be powered by a Honda-powered engine, but would have a higher power output than the current engine.

The hybrid engine would also be able to reach higher speeds, which could help the team improve its qualifying performance.

The hybrid engine will also be able to run on a wider range of fuel types, which could help the team improve its performance in the wet.

290," GTE-R, the most powerful sports car of the year, is due to return to showrooms in the US later this month.

The company said in a statement on Friday it would not reveal the price until the car's launch in the US, but that it would be ""extremely competitive"" with its rival, the Porsche 911 GT3 R.

The announcement comes as Porsche has been forced to respond to the growing number of lawsuits filed in the US against the carmaker.

A judge in California has ordered the company to pay $14.5m (£8.1m) to two former employees, including one who sued the company for allegedly forcing him to work for less than minimum wage.

The lawsuit was filed in 2014 by a former employee of the Porsche engineering division who claimed he was made to work for less than minimum wage, and that he was paid a total of $19.75 an hour for his work.

Porsche said at the time that it was ""pleased"" with the judge's decision.

""We are confident that the outcome of this case will have a positive impact on our business and on our employees' well-being,"" the company said in a statement.

""We will continue to work with the courts, government and the relevant agencies to ensure that the rights of our employees are protected.""<|endoftext|>The French police have arrested a man who they say is believed to be a member of the Islamic State"

The decision to take the campaign to the country's political capital was made in a meeting with French President Francois Hollande and the leader of the main opposition Socialist party, Nicolas Sarkozy.

Mr Farage has been campaigning in France for the past month and is expected to win the election on Sunday.

He has also previously said he would vote Leave but would not vote for the UK to leave the EU.
