The deal, which will allow Mercedes to control the majority of the German automaker's shareholding, is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

Mercedes-Benz said it would continue to operate as an independent company.

""It's a pretty good day for the industry,"" said Richard Denniss, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.

""Mercedes will be able to do a lot of things with its shareholding, and that will be a good thing for the industry.""

While the deal makes it easier for the company to sell its shares, it also allows it to use the cash to buy back its remaining shares, which are worth about $5.5 billion.

The deal will give Mercedes the ability to expand its operations in the U.S. and Europe, and also give it a more stable operating environment, in a market where the rising cost of global products such as cars and trucks is pushing automakers to cut costs.

The deal also includes a $1.6 billion cash dividend.

The investment will be made in a $60 million deal with Mexico's state-owned oil company, Pemex, to build the C-Class sedan. Pemex will also contribute $1 billion to the project, which will be financed using a $1 billion loan from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The new plant will build the C-Class sedan in Mexico, a move that will raise the company's total U.S. production of the sedan to about 2,000 vehicles.

The C-Class will be the first of Mercedes-Benz's luxury brands to be built in Mexico, with the luxury brand's U.S. production of the luxury brand's C-Class sedan expected to end in the second half of this year.

The plant will be located near the town of Monterrey, about 30 miles north of Mexico City.

The American company said the plant will be able to produce the C-Class sedan in a quarter of the time it currently does, and will be able to meet current production quotas.

The plant will also offer a new line of performance cars, including the S-Class.

The case is one of several that could determine the future of the Affordable Care Act, a key element of President Donald Trump's agenda. The law requires that all health plans cover abortion care, though some states have allowed some exceptions.

The court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on March 26.

The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in June that a provision of the health care law that requires states to allow abortion clinics to remain open during the first trimester of pregnancy violates the U.S. Constitution. The court said that the provision violated the ""fundamental right"" to equal protection under the law. The court also said that the provision was ""unconstitutionally vague.""
